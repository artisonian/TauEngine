TauEngine!
==========

This is a 2D game engine built from scratch for iOS 5's GLKit. It's powering at least one game live in the app store ([mine!](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/galaxy-wild/id457266041)), but it's still early in its development. You may be more interested in the more mature [Cocos2d](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/) framework for game development. On the other hand, maybe you enjoy GLKit's helper functions and ARCâ€”in which case, hack away!
